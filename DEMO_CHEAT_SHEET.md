## 💬 JUDGE Q&A RESPONSES

A: "6-layer pipeline: normalize → detect emergency → rank by score → adjust for dosha → structured output → log. ChatGPT just generates text."

A: "Backend emergency detection with 20+ keywords. Immediate alert, no AI delay. Plus structured responses and clear disclaimers."

**Q: "What about cultural authenticity?"**
A: "Authentic 8-question dosha assessment. Algorithm boosts remedies that balance the user's specific dosha. Not superficial."

**Q: "Is this scalable?"**
A: "Supabase database, Render backend, modular architecture, RLS security, response time tracking. Production-ready."

**Q: "Can users save remedies?"**
A: "Yes! Full CRUD with Supabase, star/unstar buttons, toast notifications, persistent storage."
