- Emergency detection guardrails  
- Ranked symptom matching  
- Dosha-based personalization  
- Structured medical-grade responses  
- Full Supabase-backed persistence

### 1️⃣ Input Normalization  
Cleans and parses symptoms for structured analysis.

### 2️⃣ Emergency Detection  
Backend detection of 20+ critical symptoms with immediate alert response.

### 3️⃣ Ranked Symptom Matching  
Deterministic matching with transparent relevance scoring.

### 4️⃣ Dosha-Aware Personalization  
Remedy ranking adjusted based on Vata / Pitta / Kapha constitution.

### 5️⃣ AI Refinement Layer
